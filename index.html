            Yoga is an ancient practice focusing on breathing, flexibility and
            strength to boost mental and wellbeing. It is composed of a group of
            physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines. <br />The
            main components of yoga are breathing and postures (a series of
            movements designed to increase strength and flexibility.) <br />The
            practice is said to have originated thousands of years ago in India
            and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. Here
            we explore where it emerged from, what elements make yoga unique,
            and how it has been adopted by people all over the world.

            Joseph Henry (December 17, 1797[1][2]– May 13, 1878) was an American
            physicist and inventor who served as the first secretary of the
            Smithsonian Institution. He was the secretary for the National
            Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the
            Smithsonian Institution.[3] He also served as president of the
            National Academy of Sciences from 1868 to 1878.
            <br />While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the
            electromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also discovered
            mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, though Faraday
            was the first to make the discovery and publish his
            results.[4][5][6] Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical
            device.

            Yogurt (UK: /ˈjɒɡərt/; US: /ˈjoʊɡərt/,[1] from Ottoman Turkish:
            یوغورت, Turkish: yoğurt;[a] also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or
            yoghourt) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.[2]
            Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic
            acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and
            characteristic tart flavor.[2] Cow's milk is most commonly used to
            make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels,
            and yaks is also used to produce yogurt. The milk used may be
            homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk
            produces substantially different results.
